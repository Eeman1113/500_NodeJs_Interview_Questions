# --- Main Application Logic ---
try:
    # Load the data from the local CSV file, assuming no header
    df = pd.read_csv('./index.csv', header=None)
    
    # --- Data Cleaning and Preparation ---
    # Assign names to only the columns we need: Question and Answer
    # This effectively ignores the first 'Category' column
    df = df.iloc[:, 1:] # Keep only the second and third columns
    df.columns = ["Question", "Answer"]
    
    # Handle potential missing answers
    df["Answer"] = df["Answer"].fillna("No answer provided.")
    df.dropna(subset=["Question"], inplace=True) # Only drop rows if the question itself is empty

    # Create a sortable numeric column from the question number.
    # This is more robust and won't drop rows if a question number is missing.
    df['Question_Num'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Question'].str.split('.').str[0], errors='coerce')
